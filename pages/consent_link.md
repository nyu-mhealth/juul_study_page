Please review the below informed consent document. If you are eligible for the study and interested in participating, you will need to read and sign this form when you enroll in our office. 

----------------------

#### ABOUT THE STUDY
----------------------
You are being invited to take part in a research study. Your participation is voluntary which means you can choose whether or not you want to take part in this study. People who agree to take part in research studies are called "participants", "subjects" or "research subjects". These words are used throughout this consent form. Before you can make your decision, you will need to know what the study is about, the possible risks and benefits of being in this study, and what you will have to do in this study. You may also decide to discuss this study and this form with your family, friends, or doctor. If you have any questions about the study or about this form, please ask us. If you decide to take part in this study, you must sign this form. We will give you a copy of this form signed by you for you to keep.

#### WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?
----------------------
The purpose of this study is to assess smokers' opinions about one or more "electronic nicotine delivery systems" (ENDS), also sometimes called electronic cigarettes, E-cigs, or vaporizers. What we learn from this study will help us understand the degree that ENDS are satisfying and/or pleasurable for smokers. As you are being asked to volunteer in a research study, this consent/authorization form includes information that is meant to help you decide whether or not you would like to take part.

#### HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY? HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE STUDY?
----------------------
The study lasts about 5-weeks, but the effort required is relatively low. We estimate that the following number of subjects will enroll in this study: 160 

#### WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO IN THE STUDY?
----------------------
This is NOT a study about quitting or smoking cessation, so during the study you are encouraged to use cigarettes as much or as little as you want on any given day. In addition to any cigarette smoking you choose to do, you will be asked to try out a cutting-edge vaporizer or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS), and you will be provided with refills as needed in a flavor or your choosing. To enroll in the study you must visit our designated a NYU mHealth study site near Washington Square in Greenwich Village so that we can verify your smoking status and photo ID, provide you with an ENDS device and supplies, show you how to use the ENDS device if needed and answer any other questions. You are required to bring a pack of your preferred brand of cigarettes to this initial visit so that we can document you cigarette preferences in a precise way.

If you participate in this study you will be asked to track your cigarette and ENDS smoking over a total of 6 weeks. You would do this by responding to text messages that we would send you about 4 times per day. These very brief messages would ask about smoking and ENDS use, and would not require more than a minute or two of your time

The study requires that you only use the ENDS device provided to you by the study team. All participants will receive their ENDS device AFTER they have completed a 1-week observation period. Participants are required to save all used ENDS liquid cartridges and bring in all pods to each office visit. If you successfully complete the study you will be gifted any ENDS device(s) you tested during the study (each retails for about $35), in addition to the monetary incentives described in the "Incentives" section below.

+ Your Screening Visit 

This visit takes about 15 minutes. During this visit, we will confirm that you are a smoker and that you are able to respond to text messages using your own cellphone with SMS texting capabilities. Then, you will provide informed consent and we will enroll you in the study. You will be asked to respond to text message prompts 5 times daily related to your cigarette consumption for 1 week. You will also be asked to take a “breath test” to measure carbon monoxide levels.

+ Visits 2 - 4

After you have tracked your cigarette consumption for 1 week, you will be asked to come back into our office to receive your e-cigarette device and nicotine pods. You can continue to smoke cigarettes as normal, and use the e-cigarette device as you choose. We will continue to assess your cigarette and e-cigarette consumption with 5 texts daily for the following four weeks. Note that after two weeks, you will be asked to come back into the office and pick up more pods for your e-cigarette device. We will also collect all used and unused pods, from the previous two weeks, at this time. At each study visit, we will assess carbon monoxide (CO) breath levels using a non-invasive CO analyzer. After week 5, you will not receive any more text message surveys, but we will ask you to come to our office one more time for a CO measurement. At this time we will again collect all used and unused pods.

#### RISKS AND BENEFITS
----------------------

+ The main risks if you participate in the study are the risks of loss of privacy and confidentiality. However, the risk of your information being seen is extremely low because of strong computer-based security systems.

+ Subjects may experience side effects from using an electronic cigarette including mouth and throat irritation, mouth and throat dryness and dry cough.

+ Participants may benefit from harm reduction due to switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes, but this is a new area of research for which the results of the proposed study are applicable.

#### WHAT IF NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE?
----------------------
During the course of this study we may find more information that could be important to you. This includes information that might cause you to change your mind about being in the study. We will notify you as soon as possible if such information becomes available.

#### INCENTIVES
----------------------
You will be paid up to $226.50 in gift card for completing ALL the surveys (approximately 5 weeks) and study visits. 

#### CONFIDENTIALITY
----------------------
Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained numerically by coding all data and deidentifying personal information.

#### VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL AND SHARING OF INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

+ It is your choice to be in this study. No one can force you to be in the study. No one can force you to stay in the study. You can leave the study at any time. Leaving the study will not affect the care you receive. You will still receive the same high level of expert care you were receiving at NYU School of Medicine before you became part of the study.

+ The information collected from you will only be used by the researchers and research staff at NYU mHealth. It could also be shared with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), but any data to be shared would be de-identified, which means that it would not include any information that could potentially identify you.

##### If you have questions, concerns or complaints regarding your participation in this research study or if you have any questions about your rights as a research subject, you should speak with the Principal Investigator.  If a member of the research team cannot be reached or you want to talk to someone other than those working on the study, you may contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at (212) 263-4110.
